Then tilting towards the various field he has worked on and the obstacles he has encountered while working on many problems then coming up with a solution to the problems for the right reasons. There are some areas were Dr. E.R Davidson has worked on some of them are Excited States Calculations, Bonding in clusters, Shake-up Spectra, etc.},
