  annote = {This article provides a personal outlook on the progression of quantum chemistry from the eyes of someone working in this area. It starts with a excerpt that explains how chemistry has two seperate sides, those that look for the wrong answer for the right reason and those that look for the right answer for the wrong reason. This divided early quantum chemists that debated between the two ideas. The majority of the article explains Davidson's personal experience in the field as it developed. He explains the progression from the days he was in high school all the way to post-doc. It gives a great perspective on how it feels to work in a devoloping industry.},

  annote = {This article explains the multitude of different theories/ models used to describe the structure and energies of molecules. It goes into extreme detail into each of the models and the histories behind them. Raghavachari stats by giving an general topic and then breaks down the theories underneath that general topic. This method does not follow any particular order in presenting the topics, like going through the history in choronological order. Rather, it breaks down huge topics into subtopics giving an overall view of certain theories.},

The ariticle starts with a general overivew of common quantum chemistry principles to give the reader an overview. This overview helps the reader better understand the more complex concepts later in the article. To finish the article, Pople explains the future improvement of certain models.},
